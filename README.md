# Pig Dice Game
Pig is a folk jeopardy dice game described by John Scarne in 1945, and was an ancestor of the modern game Pass the Pigs® (originally called PigMania®).

## Instructions
+ The game of Pig is a very simple jeopardy dice game in which two players race to reach 100 points.
+ Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the players holds and added the sum of the rolls into his score ( i.e the turn total ). At any time during a player's turn , the player is faced with two decisons:
   + roll - If the player rolls a
      + 1: the player scores nothing and it becomes the opponent's turn
      + 2 - 6: the number is added to the player's turn total and the player's turn continues.
   + hold - The turn total is added to the player's score and it becomes the opponent's turn.

This is a 1 v 1 game, where the lighter theme indicates the current player. ( computer as a player to be implemented soon )
